# Sales--Time-Series-Analysis-and-sales-Forecasting Using Python
Time series analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze and model time-dependent data. In this method, data is collected at regular intervals over time, and patterns, trends, and seasonality are identified and analyzed to make predictions about future values.
Forecasting, on the other hand, involves using the information derived from time series analysis to predict future values of the time-dependent data. This can involve using statistical models, machine learning algorithms, or other techniques to make predictions based on historical trends, patterns, and seasonality.
Time series analysis and forecasting are used in a wide range of fields, including economics, finance, marketing, engineering, E-commerce and many others. The ability to predict future values of time-dependent data can be valuable in many different applications, such as predicting future sales, stock prices, weather patterns, or traffic congestion, among others.
